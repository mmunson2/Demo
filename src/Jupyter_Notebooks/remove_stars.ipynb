    "## Leetcode #2390: Remove stars from a string\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string s, which contains stars *.\n",
    "\n",
    "In one operation, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a star in s.\n",
    "2. Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the string after all stars have been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.\n",
    "It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naive Solution\n",
    "The first thing that came to my mind was:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Loop through each index of the string\n",
    "    - If the current index is a star, go backwards and somehow remove elements\n",
    "    \n",
    "This isn't ideal as it has loops inside of loops, potentially netting a worse-than O(N) solution that this problem seems to be asking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stack Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "I pondered sliding windows for a bit before I realized that a data structure could help me out a lot here. The plan is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add non-star characters to a stack\n",
    "- If I get a star, pop the stack and don't add the star.\n",
    "- When I finish, stop treating my data structure like a stack and read it out from beginning to end.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This ensures an O(N) solution. It uses slightly more memory by making a list of strings. I can't think of an easy way to optimize this though as strings are immutable in Python and there isn't a string buffer in widespread use."
